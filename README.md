# Personal-Portfolio-MVP
This is an MVP of my Personal Portfolio, covering a lot of what I do in my life. I also have added a Suggestion part on the Contact Page where users are able to provide me suggestions regarding my Personal Website. Please feel free to give me your suggestions!



It is recommended to view this website on mac and full display to get the best outlook of the features, I am still working on the Media Queries to please feel free to use the Contact Page where I created a open form where users are able to send me any suggestions if needed. 

Note: This is not a final copy of the website, as many things are subject to change. Please stay tuned for my final product.
