<div class="des">
    I'm a rising sophomore attending the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics. 
    Outside of school, I was an participant at AllStarCode. In AllStarCode, I have learnt programming languages and entrepreneurial skills, and have used these skills to build a Capstone Project on Web Development. 
    In the Capstone Project, I was our Project Manager. As Project Manager, I suggested new ideas to our team, helped engineers put those ideas into code, boosted morale of our engineers throughout the rigorous project, 
    and kept our team organized and collaborative throughout the Capstone. Our end result came to be a sleek modern business theme website about our team and how we aspire to give back to our communities. 
    Some skills I have gained throughout the program are listed in the skills section additonally with some skills I gained throughout my free-time.
