   <div class="Who">
    <p>Hi, my name is Rafsan. I come from the Bronx, NY. 
        Currently I am a rising sophomore at The Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics. I live in a community where I have lots of people who support me, from my parents to relatives to even “strangers” .     I refer to them as my peers who know who I am. We all maintained a good relationship, not getting into arguments often. I visited multiple places around the world, and if you would like to know more, you should visit the About Page to know more about me.
