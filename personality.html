   <div class="interest">
      <p>I have had a ton of interests as a kid. From being an astronaut, to be a historian, now I'm deciding between being a Web Developer, Data Analyst, or a Cybersecurity Engineer. My interests mainly came from what I watched on youtube. From suddenly watching a video of astronauts excited to discover new things in space, to watching documentaries of The Cold War, to now watching videos of the benefits and drawbacks of Web, Cybersecurity, and Data Science.  Now that I look back, sorry for the informality but, dang, that was a long reach(your still 14 bro.) Right now I am interested of being a Web Developer and designing websites.

          <p>This was a really long time ago, but this is a picture of me in 2014 when I went to Bangladesh for the first time in my life. I don't remember much but this was a one in a lifetime experience as I had so much fun seeing my family. Some memories that stuck up to me from this experience was when I went fishing, as fishing was popular in Bangladesh. I also went to see how a average day of school was im Bangladesh, and it was really different. I noticed how the curriculum is quite old and how the students are some shenanigans, like I remember one time when some kid decided to waste the whole powder and drop it on the floor, and teachers used to hit people, so when it was time for me to go home, I remember the teacher had a stick to probably hit or scare the student for his misdoings. Well that was quite an interesting experience. I actually went a year ago back in 2023 to Bangladesh, and it was still really fun, but I did enjoy the first time I went as I was baffled at many of the things uncommon in the West.</p>

           <p>You might notice that these pictures are a long time ago, well I went to these places after when it was took, its just that I didn't want to put the more recent pictures as these pictures have more meaning back then than the more recent ones(it's actually cuz I claim I look better on these pics than the ones more recent). Regardless, this was another fun experience I had. The most notable memory was actually when I went to my relative's house, as it was the best house I ever visited and stayed at my whole life. The house was $2 million dollars when they bought it, but considering inflation it's almost 3 million dollars, but regardless, the house was so big and it was spotless clean, so that added another level of elegance to the house. The area was amazing, as it was in a chill surburban neighborhood with stores nearby. </p>

          <p>This is a picture I took when I went to Washington, DC. This picture doesn't show as much as the others, but this is a simple picture I took to edit and see how this would look edited. This ended up turning out as the best picture I took. This was taken in Capitol Hill in the heart of DC. Now enough babbling about the context, now lets get onto the experience. The experience was really fun, as this shifted my point of view of buildings. Back then, I used to think buildings don't look too good in attraction sites, so why do people visit places like DC. Well, that shifted quick. When I went to DC, I saw why people visit these cool places with a fascinating history. The buildings look a lot bigger in real life than in the photos, so when I saw The White House, I was baffled by how nice and spectacular it looked. DC is a really nice place and highly recommend to visit. </p>

        <br>
       <p>These hobbies highlight who I am and what I like to do.  These hobbies are so important to me as they have helped me so much in my life. My life is more of a socially-isolated one, so incorporating these hobbies into my life has helped me cure this loneliness and immerse myself into the real world.
